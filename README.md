**Code Cleveland** is a collective effort to foster the local tech community by providing support and structure to the people of Northeast Ohio.

We believe that an active and thriving community can play a monumental role in NEO's success by helping to:

- promote the local economy
- create and fill jobs
- connect like-minded individuals
- improve Cleveland's public image
- attract new and prior talent
- provide a natural entry point for beginners

joefiorini: The tech community means more than just programmers; it’s anyone involved in the business of technology (which typically means software, but _could_ mean hardware as well)

A support network that helps other meetups get off the ground or keep moving, and also maybe has its own events promoting the tech scene in general

#### Branding

#### Bootcamps
#### Happy Hour

#### Meetup Groups
#### Newsletter
#### Podcast
#### Apparel (stickers, shirts, swag)

### Is this just another Cleveland tech meetup group?

No! The last thing Cleveland needs is another meetup (although I am sure we will meetup :slightly_smiling_face:)
The only structure the cleveland tech scene actually has is this slack team with 85 channels.

### Is the goal to provide a place for topics that don't fit under an established group?
yes, that is part of it

### Is the goal to provide another "venue" for those topics that might fit under an established group that doesn't meet regularly?

could be a result, but not a focus or founding goal

### Is the goal to create a support network,  like a community organization?  (Lakewood Alive, Ohio City, Inc?)
yes, that is part of it, but bigger; would be for NEO as a whole, not just a neighborhood.

#### Launch League
Launch League has been attempting to do this for a while in Akron. We now have 5 meetups in Akron that are all under the same umbrella. We actually have the organizers of those meetings meet quarterly just to talk through successes and failures, potential improvements, etc. I think it's been going really well for us in Akron. Our scenario consisted of a lot less traffic of course and less meetups that were competing so it naturally fit.
 
I always think more organizer conversations are better. **I've seen days in this tech Slack where people are advertising different meetups for the same day, those collisions hurt attendance quite a bit in the more broad meetups**

rae: i’m a bit tired of the assumption that tech === startups

1.) I generally don't care what tech you used, I care what you made and how you did it
if I wanted tech specific groups, I could go nerd out at those in Cleveland whenever

but the CLE ecosystem in each of these groups isn't big enough to offer enough variety

in ideas, contributions, locations, speakers etc

2.) When you get to the tech specific communities, there is a sense of elitism that makes it easy to make new folks feel like they don't belong

even if you don't mean to
Introduction to GraphQL doesn't do anything for anyone except supernerds

3.) Cleveland is very startup focused. I don't want to hear about your money problems anymore

4.) If I have to go to X once again to see the same meetup speaking on Y where I know Z will all be there I'll need to pinch myself to make sure I'm not in the twilight zone

There's this sort rigid backbone based on what I can only label as "how things have been done"
