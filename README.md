# Code Cleveland Manifesto

**Code Cleveland** is a collective effort to foster the local tech community by providing support and structure to the people of Northeast Ohio.

We believe that an active and thriving community can play a monumental role in NEO's success by helping to:

- promote the local economy
- create and fill jobs
- connect like-minded individuals
- improve Cleveland's public image
- attract new and prior talent
- provide a natural entry point for beginners

joefiorini: The tech community means more than just programmers; it’s anyone involved in the business of technology (which typically means software, but _could_ mean hardware as well)

## Core Principles

### Process over Prowess
Just like verbal communication, there are many different methods of expressing the same idea. We are not tied to any specific technology or language; these are simply the means, not the end.

If you're interested in learning more about a specific language or methodology, we encourage you to dig deeper into the NEO meetups that are tech-specific and can help you grow a particular skillset.

### Inclusive
Objective: Be welcoming to new members of the community and help them navigate the local tech scene.

### A Word about Startups
It's pretty easy to throw around startups and tech in the same conversation, but the truth is, they're two separate beasts and should be treated as such. There's tons of support available for startups in the NEO area (think TechPint, StartMart, FlashStarts, LaunchHouse, etc.) However, not everyone wants to be a part of the Next Big Thing™ or learn how to raise seed money.

We're glad to support NEO's startup culture, but it is important for the community to be cognizant of this distinction up front.

## Objectives

### Branding
Objective: Establish a set of communal visuals for use in related web, print, and apparel projects.

### Meetup Groups
Objective: help meetup groups get off the ground or keep moving by providing a tried-and-true framework to implement.

#### Venues
- Limit driving. It's a harsh requirement, but the longer the drive, the less likely people will attend.
- Centrally located (Independence is a good suggestion for hosting a meetup, but it'd be smart to find a building that has a bit of character which may be tough to find.)
- Rotate between several different locations.

### Coworking Spaces
Objective: Provide a list of all of the active partner and participating co-working spaces in the area as a resource for those looking for a place to call their office for the day or month. Potentially provide discounts to folks being referred through.

## Call for Volunteers
This is a big project and is lot of work. Think you can help out with any of the above? Open up a new issue and let's talk.

## Questions

### Is this just another Cleveland tech meetup group?

No! The last thing Cleveland needs is another meetup (although I am sure we will meetup :slightly_smiling_face:)
The only structure the cleveland tech scene actually has is this slack team with 85 channels.

## Launch League
Launch League has been attempting to do this for a while in Akron. We now have 5 meetups in Akron that are all under the same umbrella. We actually have the organizers of those meetings meet quarterly just to talk through successes and failures, potential improvements, etc. I think it's been going really well for us in Akron. Our scenario consisted of a lot less traffic of course and less meetups that were competing so it naturally fit.
 
I always think more organizer conversations are better. **I've seen days in this tech Slack where people are advertising different meetups for the same day, those collisions hurt attendance quite a bit in the more broad meetups**
