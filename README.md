“Bringing developers and designers together for two days of hands on code & design talks” -> I think there should be something that is higher level, almost a support network that helps other meetups get off the ground or keep moving, and also maybe has its own events promoting the tech scene in general


### Is the goal to create another regularly scheduled meetup?

rae.krantz: no, that is too narrow of a goal; that may be a result, but is not the goal in and of itself

No! The last thing Cleveland needs is another meetup (although I am sure we will meetup :slightly_smiling_face:)
The only structure the cleveland tech scene actually has is this slack channel

with 84 channels, 85 now

### Is the goal to provide a place for topics that don't fit under an established group?
yes, that is part of it

### Is the goal to provide another "venue" for those topics that might fit under an established group that doesn't meet regularly?

could be a result, but not a focus or founding goal

### Is the goal to create a support network,  like a community organization?  (Lakewood Alive, Ohio City, Inc?) (edited)
yes, that is part of it, but bigger; would be for cleveland as a whole, not just a neighborhood. adding onto that though — NEO? (including akron?) or just cleveland?

making decisions requires you to have some sort of constraint; I wouldn’t be against helping a group in a completely different state if absolutely needed, but in general you need some way to express what you’re about

I think NEO is a good constraint

Launch League has been attempting to do this for a while in Akron. We now have 5 meetups in Akron that are all under the same umbrella. We actually have the organizers of those meetings meet quarterly just to talk through successes and failures, potential improvements, etc. I think it's been going really well for us in Akron. Our scenario consisted of a lot less traffic of course and less meetups that were competing so it naturally fit.
 
I always think more organizer conversations are better. I've seen days in this tech Slack where people are advertising different meetups for the same day, those collisions hurt attendance quite a bit in the more broad meetups


joefiorini To me the tech community means more than just programmers; it’s anyone involved in the business of technology (which typically means software, but _could_ mean hardware as well)

rae: i’m a bit tired of the assumption that tech === startups, fwiw


Dave: I've felt very frustrated with the community offerings here

1.) I generally don't care what tech you used, I care what you made and how you did it
if I wanted tech specific groups, I could go nerd out at those in Cleveland whenever

but the CLE ecosystem in each of these groups isn't big enough to offer enough variety

in ideas, contributions, locations, speakers etc

2.) When you get to the tech specific communities, there is a sense of elitism that makes it easy to make new folks feel like they don't belong

even if you don't mean to
Introduction to GraphQL doesn't do anything for anyone except supernerds

3.) Cleveland is very startup focused. I don't want to hear about your money problems anymore

4.) If I have to go to X once again to see the same meetup speaking on Y where I know Z will all be there I'll need to pinch myself to make sure I'm not in the twilight zone

There's this sort rigid backbone based on what I can only label as "how things have been done"
But, I wasn't around for Burning River Dev days so I could be missing something
