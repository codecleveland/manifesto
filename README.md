“Bringing developers and designers together for two days of hands on code & design talks” -> I think there should be something that is higher level, almost a support network that helps other meetups get off the ground or keep moving, and also maybe has its own events promoting the tech scene in general


### Is the goal to create another regularly scheduled meetup?

rae.krantz: no, that is too narrow of a goal; that may be a result, but is not the goal in and of itself

No! The last thing Cleveland needs is another meetup (although I am sure we will meetup :slightly_smiling_face:)
The only structure the cleveland tech scene actually has is this slack channel

with 84 channels, 85 now

### Is the goal to provide a place for topics that don't fit under an established group?
yes, that is part of it

### Is the goal to provide another "venue" for those topics that might fit under an established group that doesn't meet regularly?

could be a result, but not a focus or founding goal

### Is the goal to create a support network,  like a community organization?  (Lakewood Alive, Ohio City, Inc?) (edited)
yes, that is part of it, but bigger; would be for cleveland as a whole, not just a neighborhood. adding onto that though — NEO? (including akron?) or just cleveland?

making decisions requires you to have some sort of constraint; I wouldn’t be against helping a group in a completely different state if absolutely needed, but in general you need some way to express what you’re about

I think NEO is a good constraint

Launch League has been attempting to do this for a while in Akron. We now have 5 meetups in Akron that are all under the same umbrella. We actually have the organizers of those meetings meet quarterly just to talk through successes and failures, potential improvements, etc. I think it's been going really well for us in Akron. Our scenario consisted of a lot less traffic of course and less meetups that were competing so it naturally fit.
 
I always think more organizer conversations are better. I've seen days in this tech Slack where people are advertising different meetups for the same day, those collisions hurt attendance quite a bit in the more broad meetups


joefiorini To me the tech community means more than just programmers; it’s anyone involved in the business of technology (which typically means software, but _could_ mean hardware as well)

rae: i’m a bit tired of the assumption that tech === startups, fwiw
