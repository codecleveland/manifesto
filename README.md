# Code Cleveland Manifesto

**Code Cleveland** is a collective effort focused on fostering the local tech community by providing support and structure to the people of Northeast Ohio.

We believe that an active and thriving community can play a monumental role in NEO's success by helping to:

- promote the local economy
- create and fill jobs
- connect like-minded individuals
- improve Cleveland's public image
- attract new and prior talent
- provide a natural entry point for beginners

joefiorini: The tech community means more than just programmers; it’s anyone involved in the business of technology (which typically means software, but _could_ mean hardware as well)

## Core Principles

### Process over Prowess
Just like verbal communication, there are many different methods of expressing the same idea. We are not tied to any specific technology or language; these are simply the means, not the end.

If you're interested in learning more about a specific language or methodology, we encourage you to dig deeper into the NEO meetups that are tech-specific and can help you grow a particular skillset.

### Diversity and Inclusiveness
We welcome and encourage new members of all skill levels to join the community and hope to empower all those interested in learning more about code and other facets within the tech community. 

### Each One Teach One
Share what you know.

### Promote Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS)

### Support net-neutrality and freedom of speech

## Objectives

### Branding

### Sponsors
Meetups and organizations cost money. Code Cleveland is always looking for good people with some interest in being close to the Cleveland tech scene who want to help out.

### Meetup Groups
Objective: help meetup groups get off the ground or keep moving by providing a tried-and-true framework to implement.

- Organizer conversations to provide feedback
- Preventing clashing meetup dates to maximize attendance.

#### Venues
- Limit driving. It's a harsh requirement, but the longer the drive, the less likely people will attend.
- Centrally located (Independence is a good suggestion for hosting a meetup, but it'd be smart to find a building that has a bit of character which may be tough to find.)
- Rotate between several different locations.

#### Childcare
- Provide childcare for meetups when requested so as to remove barriers for attendance.
- Childcare isn’t commonly requested, so it’s often not something the average meetup organizer can't put a comparative amount of time into for one or two meetups out of the year. If a central organization ran it for the collective of area meetup groups, it could be more beneficial.
- It should be free for attendees if food is free; if food is paid for by attendees it could also be paid.

### Apparel (stickers, shirts, swag)
Objective: Establish a sense of pride to be involved in the Cleveland tech community by providing wearables and stickables that don't look like they were designed by a developer.

### Coworking Spaces
Objective: Provide a list of all of the active partner and participating co-working spaces in the area as a resource for those looking for a place to call their office for the day or month. Potentially provide discounts to folks being referred through.

## Call for Volunteers
This is a big project and is lot of work. Think you can help out with any of the above? Open up a new issue and let's talk.

## Join the Discussion
Code Cleveland is primarily discussed in the [Cleveland Tech Slack team in the #codecleveland channel.](http://cleveland-tech.herokuapp.com/)

## Questions

### Is this just another Cleveland tech meetup group?

No! The last thing Cleveland needs is another meetup (although I am sure we will meetup :slightly_smiling_face:)
The only structure the cleveland tech scene actually has is this slack team with 85 channels.

### Aren't there other startup support groups in Cleveland?
It's pretty easy to throw around startups and tech in the same conversation, but the truth is, they're two separate beasts and should be treated as such. There's tons of support available for startups in the NEO area (think TechPint, StartMart, FlashStarts, LaunchHouse, etc.) However, not everyone wants to be a part of the Next Big Thing™ or learn how to raise seed money.

We're glad to support NEO's startup culture, but it is important for the community to be cognizant of this distinction up front.
